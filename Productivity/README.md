## 1. TeX

TeX is a typesetting system.  It's quite helpful for scientific document as it makes the process of writing equations and compiling your bibliography.

To download the TeX software:
* Unix/Linux: [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
* Mac: [MacTex](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) plus [TeXShop](http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/) frontend
* Windows: [proTeXt](https://www.tug.org/protext/) (comes with [TeXStudio](\href{)http://texstudio.sourceforge.net) frontend)

In addition, I like to use Excel to format tables (and for easy viewing) and thus often use the Excel plug-in [Excel2Latex](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/excel2latex?lang=en).

To get started using TeX, you might look at the [LaTeX tutorial PDF chapter](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/blob/master/Tutorials/LaTeX/LaTeX_tutorial.pdf) in the [`/Tutorials/LaTeX/`](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/tree/master/Tutorials/LaTeX) directory of the Open Source Macro Bootcamp.  This provides a great reference for installing and running LaTeX. Also included in that directory is a template [`LaTeX_probset_template.tex`](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/blob/master/Tutorials/LaTeX/LaTeX_probset_template.tex) as well as the PDf file [(`LaTeX_probset_template.pdf`)](https://github.com/OpenSourceMacro/BootCamp2017/blob/master/Tutorials/LaTeX/LaTeX_probset_template.pdf) generated by compiling that `.tex` file.  You won't structure a document exactly like this template, but it will help you get started.


## 2. Text editor suggestions

In our recommended Python development workflow, you will write Python scripts and modules (`*.py` files) in a text editor. Then you will run those scripts from your terminal. You will want a capable text editor for developing your code. Many capable text editors exist, but I recommend two

1. [Atom](https://atom.io)
2. [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com)

Atom is completely free. A trial version of Sublime Text 3 is available for free, but a licensed version is $70 (US dollars). In the following subsections, I provide some of the details of each of these text editors.


### 2.1. Atom

[Atom](https://atom.io) is an open source text editor developed by people at GitHub.com. This editor has all the features of Sublime Text 3, but it also allows users full customizability. Further, it has been a while now that the users of Atom have surpassed the critical mass necessary to keep the editor progressing with the most cutting edge additions.

There are several packages you'll want to install with Atom.  Once Atom is installed, you can add packages by navigating Atom->Preferences->Install and then typing in the name of the package you would like to install.

For work with Python, I recommend the following packages be installed:

* MagicPython
* python-indent
* tabs-to-spaces
* minimap
* open-recent
* linter-python-pep8

For development with GitHub I recommend:

* merge-conflict

If using LaTex in this editor, the following packages are helpful:

* atom-latex
* latextools
* autocomplete-bitex
* dictionary
* latexer
* pdf-view

In addition, you will also want to download the [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net) PDF viewer to aid in displaying PDF files compiled from TeX with Atom.

### 2.2 Sublime Text 3

[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com) is the most widely used and versatile private software text editor. It has tremendous flexibility, as well as the polish of a piece of professional software. Sublime Text 3 will cost $70 for a license, although you can use a trial version indefinitely without charge while only having to suffer through frequent reminders to buy the full version.


## 3. Working in the Command Line

It's helpful to know your way around the Unix/DOS command line.  This is the way I recommend interacting with Git (discussed below) and is also how I typically run Python scripts.  It's also the only way you can typically interact with remote servers on which you might store data or run software (such as the [Research Cyber Infrastructure](http://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/division_of_information_technology/rci/) clusters on campus).

Some of the most common commands you'll use are summarized in the table below.

| Command                                              | Unix                                                                                                         | DOS                                                                                                                              |

## 4. Git and GitHub tutorial

I have included a tutorial on using [Git and GitHub.com](https://github.com/jdebacker/CompEcon_Fall17/blob/master/Productivity/git_tutorial.pdf). Git is a powerful version control software that comes natively installed on many machines and is widely used. GitHub.com is the most widely used online platform for hosting open source projects and integrating with Git software. Git has a significant learning curve, but it is essential for large collaborations that involve software development.

| Functionality                                               | Git Command                                                      |

## 5. Instructions for installing the Anaconda distribution of Python

We will be using the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language and many of its powerful libraries for writing the code to solve and estimate economic models. Using an open source language, such as Python, has the advantage of being free and accessible for anyone who wishes to contribute to this project. Being open source also allows Python users to go into the source code of any function to modify it to suit one's needs.

I recommend that you download the Anaconda distribution of Python provided by [Continuum Analytics](https://www.continuum.io/). I recommend the most recent stable version of Python, which is currently Python 3.6. This can be done from the [Anaconda download page](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux machines. The code we will be writing uses common Python libraries such as `NumPy`, `SciPy`, `pickle`, `os`, `matplotlib`, and `time`.


## 6. PEP 8, docstring commenting, and module structure

Computer code executes some set of commands in an organized way. In every case, there are often many ways to execute a set of instructions--some ways more efficient than others. However, code has at least three functions.

1. Efficiently execute the task at hand.
2. Be accessible and usable to other programmers.
3. Be scalable and integrable with other projects and procedures.

Bill Gates is credited with the following plea for efficiency and parsimony in code writing.

> "Measuring programming progress by lines of code is like measuring aircraft building progress by weight."

Strong support for points (2) and (3) is Eagleson's Law.

> "Any code of your own that you haven't looked at for six or more months might as well have been written by someone else."

Because of the latter two characteristics, Python code has developed some conventions and best practices, some of which have been institutionalized in the [PEP 8--Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) ("PEP" stands for Python Enhancement Proposals). Key examples PEP 8 Python coding conventions are the following.

* Indents should be 4 spaces (not tab)
* Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters long blocks of text being limited to 72 characters
* Use a space after a comma
* Use a space before and after arithmetic operators

In the text editors Atom and Sublime Text 3 you can install Linter packages that highlight areas of your code that break PEP 8 rules and tell you what the violation is.
